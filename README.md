# Hand Gesture Control System

This project is a Python-based hand gesture control system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI. The system captures hand movements via a webcam and translates them into mouse movements and clicks, along with other gestures such as taking screenshots.

## Features

- **Mouse Movement**: Control the mouse cursor using the tip of your index finger.
- **Left Click**: Perform a left mouse click by forming a specific gesture with your fingers.
- **Right Click**: Perform a right mouse click by forming a different specific gesture.
- **Double Click**: Trigger a double-click using another gesture.
- **Screenshot**: Take a screenshot by performing a specific hand gesture.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI
- Pynput

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file yet, you can create one with the following content:
   ```
   opencv-python
   mediapipe
   pyautogui
   pynput
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the main script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   This will start the webcam and allow you to control the mouse with hand gestures.

2. **Gestures**:
   - **Mouse Movement**: Move your index finger to control the mouse cursor.
   - **Left Click**: Form a specific gesture where your thumb and index finger are close, and the other fingers are open.
   - **Right Click**: Another gesture with a different set of fingers.
   - **Double Click**: Another specific gesture using both index and middle fingers.
   - **Screenshot**: Bring your thumb and index finger close together, while the other fingers are open, to take a screenshot.

3. **Exit**: Press the `q` key to exit the program.

## How It Works

The system uses the following steps:

1. **Hand Detection**: The MediaPipe Hands module detects the hand and landmarks.
2. **Gesture Recognition**: The positions of the hand landmarks are analyzed to detect specific gestures.
3. **Action Trigger**: Based on the detected gesture, appropriate actions like mouse movement, clicking, or taking a screenshot are triggered.

## Customization

You can customize the gesture recognition logic in the `detect_gesture` function within the script. Modify the `utils.get_angle` and `utils.get_distance` conditions to tweak how gestures are detected.
